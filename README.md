# Knitting Pattern Designer
An app that lets you create your own knitting patterns, to store and use again. Currently in the rudimentary stages and needs to be worked up to full functionality. Here is a link to the site: [Knitting Pattern Designer](https://damp-meadow-65069.herokuapp.com/)

## Each User Can:
- Sign up to the app
- Create a design
- Edit a design
- View a list of users
- View all designs
- Log in to the app

## Technologies
This app is a full stack CRUD app. It was created using:

- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- jQuery & Ajax
- CSS & SASS
- HTML
- PostGreSQL

## Approach
I had started this project by making a smaller one that randomly generated a pattern. I wanted to expand on that idea by letting users create their own designs, which they could store and come back to.
I came up with a database structure I thought would be good to hold all the information and went on from there. Wireframing all of the pages I thought I would need, and then building out the functionality for each major page.

I ended up using a database structure that I will eventually change. It is currently inefficient and was difficult to program the functionality of saving and printing the designs.
